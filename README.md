# Draft Cards

React implementation of my [Upgrade Draft Scorecards](https://zachknox.com/bingo/drafts).

## Local Development

You'll need Node.js 14 or newer. YOu can install dependencies with `yarn`, and start the application with `yarn start`.

To build a production ready version of this app, run `yarn build`.

There are a lot of scripts in the `package.json` that were provided by Create React App. You probably don't need to worry about them.
