# Draft Cards

React implementation of my [Upgrade Draft Scorecards](https://zmknox.com/bingo/drafts).

## Local Development

You'll need Node.js 16 or newer. You can install dependencies with `npm install`, and start the application with `npm start`.

To build a production ready version of this app, run `npm run build`.

There are a lot of scripts in the `package.json` that were provided by Create React App. You probably don't need to worry about them.
